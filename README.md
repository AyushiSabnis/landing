2. Activate Github pages for your new repo
3. Personalize

# Personalization

## Update officers list

1. Go to [_data/officers.yml](_data/officers.yml)
2. Edit the info for the appropriate position

## Add photo albums to carousel

1. I've been hosting the photo albums on the csgsa@colorado.edu Google Photos account
2. Add a disclaimer to the album (wherever its hosted)
> If you'd like your photo removed from this album, please email csgsa@colorado.edu
3. Add one photo to the [assets/img/](assets/img/) directory as a preview image
4. Go to [_data/carousel.yml](_data/carousel.yml)
5. Copy and paste the following text
```
- title: Winter Celebration 2016
  image-url: assets/img/2016wintercel.jpg
  url: https://www.flickr.com/photos/139176861@N07/sets/72157675895676372

```
6. Edit the properties as described in the text you just copied

## Add a newsletter post
1. Write a post in markdown
2. Add the header 
```
---
layout: post
---
```
3. If you want a image to appear with the excerpt on the front page, use the header
```
---
layout: brochure
img: /assets/img/<file>
img_alt: <alt text>
---
```
This will create a post with a two column layout with the image on the left and the text on the right. There is no need to include the image in the markdown. 

4. The default excerpt shown on the front page is the first paragraph. If you want to have a custom length excerpt, add `<!--more-->` after your desired excerpt. 
5. Save to [_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-Title-of-post-seperated-with-dashes.md](_posts/)
6. Posts automatically appear on the front page in the "Newsletter" section in an abbreviated form with a link to the full version. They also are automatically linked to on the archive page. I recommend checking that everything looks right in both locations. 

## Add/change footer links

You can change footer links by editing the file  [_data/footer_links.yml](_data/footer_links.yml)

## Global variables

You can change various strings across the site, including the title of your app on [_config.yml](_config.yml)

## Theme variables

Main colors can be changed on [_config.yml](_config.yml). For more "deep" styling, you can edit all styling in [assets/css/main.scss](assets/css/main.scss)
