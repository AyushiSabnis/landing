## Spring 2020 Town hall

Hey all,

We will be discussing graduate student issues and topics *with faculty* at the Computer Science graduate town hall this semester on _April 23rd_ from _3:30-4:45_.  Help us set the agenda below!

This event is open to CS graduate students, and we are inviting faculty to join this time for the first part in order to foster communication with faculty so they better understand our needs as students.
