# Welcome

Hello!

Now that Rajshree has sent out the first, of what we’re sure will be many, emails in the run up to August, we wanted to introduce you to the Computer Science Graduate Student Association (CSGSA).

CSGSA is a student organization run by and for graduate students from the Computer Science Department at CU Boulder. Its main goal is to foster community amongst graduate students in the Department of Computer Science and other affiliated departments/institutes. We arrange a variety of events throughout the year, and serve as a central forum of representation for graduate students, representing graduate students’ interests to the department and broader university administration. We aim to always keep you informed of what's going on, opportunities available, and have some fun along the way!

As mentioned in Rajshree’s email we will be having a social as part of orientation. This is a great opportunity to meet grad students in the department! We will have pizza and a Scavenger Hunt!

We are trying to plan some events to help folks get settled in here in Boulder and get set up. Once you have decided your travel plans, please let us know when you will be arriving in Boulder by [filling out this form](https://forms.gle/HaCCyknEMCxj3FcRA)!

If you’d like to learn more about the CSGSA and who we are, check out our [website](https://bouldercsgrads.org/)!

For now we have listed a few resources below that might be useful as you plan your move! We look forward to welcoming you in the fall.

CSGSA


## Slack

There are two slack channels you need to know about:

Rajshree has set up a slack just for incoming students. There are also some CSGSA reps on this channel. If you have questions for Rajshree, or discussion specific to starting at CU Boulder, this channel will be ideal. Rajshree will also be using this channel to communicate information in the run up to Fall. You should have received an invite to this slack.

We also have a general slack for CS Grad Students in the department. This is all current graduate students, **with no staff or faculty**. You will need a @colorado.edu email address in order to join. Once you are logged in, We recommend #newgrads, #housing, #2019cohort_phd (if applicable), and #courses if you are looking to get advice from current students!
