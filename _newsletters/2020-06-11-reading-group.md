## Engage in discussion about oppression in academia

Hi everyone,

We hope you have taken some time to reflect on the issues of racism and oppression being brought to our collective consciousness recently. Next week, from 3-4p on June 18, we will have an open discussion on the paper [Roles for Computing in Social Change](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04883.pdf), and would like to encourage students and faculty to join.  This is a small part in a larger effort to facilitate discussions about inequality in academia as a whole.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=318pfexvV0A) is a video summarizing the paper as well.

We hope you are able to join us for this discussion and take the time to reflect on the impacts of your actions and priorities.
