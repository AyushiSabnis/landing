## Take the 2020 Quality of Life survey

Hey all,

The CSGSA is putting out our annual quality of life survey, and would love for you to take it.  The survey will be open until _March 3rd_ and should take approximately 10-15 minutes.  

*Note: All of the questions on demographics are optional.  If you feel like answering one of them gets rid of your anonymity and you are not comfortable with that,  please do not feel like you have to answer it.  We want your honest feedback, and know anonymity is important for that.*

And as a "thank you," come grab a bagel from Woodgrain Bagels with the CSGSA on _Monday, March 2 in ECES 112 from 12-1pm_ while you take the quality of life survey, or show us that you've taken it and you can take your bagel to go!

## And mark your calendars

We will be discussing results of the Quality of Life survey (and more!) *with faculty* at the Computer Science graduate town hall this semester on _March 12th_ from _3:30-4:30p in ECCR 265_ (normal colloquium time/location.)  Suggest additional discussion topics below:
