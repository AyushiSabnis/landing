# Welcome

Hello!

To our new colleagues, welcome! To our old friends, welcome back! As we get ready for the start of another academic year, we wanted to reach out with some information about a couple of events coming up for **all students**.

See you soon!

## Scavenger Hunt
It's back! After last years success, the scavenger hunt is back, with new and improved challenges! In teams of 4 you will search the engineering canter and surrounding area to solve our clues and emerge victorious! Teams will be made up of new students and existing students - don't worry we will sort that out on the day! We will have **free food, music, and prizes!**

This is a great chance to meet new folks in the department, network and get to know everyone!

We will meet in ECES 114 at 5.30pm on Thursday August 22nd. We will have half an hour to get some food and get organized, and then the hunt will start at 6pm.

See you there!

## Professional Headshots
For the first time CSGSA is offering the opportunity to get free professional headshots taken. A professional photo is perfect for a LinkedIn profile, journal articles, posters for professional talks etc. If you want this photo can also be used on the new student directory on the department website.

Drop in to ECCR 150 between 11am and 3pm on Thursday August 22nd to get your picture taken, no appointment necessary. Just bring you buff one card and a good hair day!

We **strongly encourage everyone to take advantage of this opportunity**. A good headshot is a good career move! Don't believe us? Check out this article from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamarruda/2018/09/05/the-best-linkedin-headshots-and-how-to-create-yours/#690dde06d2fa)
