## Faculty Mentorship survey for MS students

During the Spring 2020 town hall, a request was made to provide a formal system for faculty to serve as mentors for MS students. The CSGSA brought this request to the Graduate Committee and they have agreed to start developing this program. Before this can happen, we need to know what you would like to see from a faculty mentorship program. We have included a short survey below to gather your thoughts. If you have any other feedback that does not fit into the form, please reach out to the CSGSA directly via email or Slack.
