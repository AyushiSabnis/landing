## Calling for nominations for 2020-2021 CS/TCP Committee Rep Positions

Hi all,

As the new school year approaches, we need to elect new committee representatives for the graduate committee, executive committee, and to UGGS (United Government of Graduate Students).  We highly encourage you to nominate yourself for one of these positions if you have any interest in representing student voices to the department.  (This includes incoming students!)

GSA positions will be up for election in December, so to not overhaul our entire leadership team at once.

Cheers, CSGSA
