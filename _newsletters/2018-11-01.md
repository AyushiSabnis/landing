Some of you may remember an event last year known as Friendsgiving.  Our host last year was Prof. Chris Heckman, and it was a wonderful evening full of food and merriment.  This year, Prof. Brad Hayes has graciously opened up his home for another Friendsgiving event on Saturday November 10th, 6pm at 1203 High St., Boulder.  

Part of participating in this event is bringing something to share with the group.  This can take the form of food, cutlery, **chairs**, plates, or any other miscellaneous items that might be needed.  The only way this event works is if we all work together to make a delicious meal. We would especially like to share this US holiday with our international colleagues, and welcome you to bring a traditional dish of your own to share with us! 

If you are interested in participating in this event, please [**RSVP**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SdYvYAfsSdljLnV1U8gx09lkNmgIR9PRHgFRchM8EuE/edit?usp=sharing)

## Town Hall Recap

Town Hall was last week, and you can read the full minutes [here](https://bouldercsgrads.org/2018/10/25/Town-Hall-Minutes-Fall-2018.html). 

The agenda covered three topics, degree requirements, course issues, and space needs. 

Degree requirements are currently being overhauled by the department. Keep an eye out for a survey about proposed changes. 

Not many course issues were raised by students. There was some discussion about instructor accountability to the syllabus and the expectations for 7000 level courses. Please feel free to approach one of the Grad directors if you have concerns about the way a course is being taught.

One of the biggest topics was the need for space, specifically, the need for more TA interview grading space as well as a Graduate Lounge which would be used for studying, group work, and building community. The CSGSA is working with the department to develop a "dedicated space" plan for graduate students.
