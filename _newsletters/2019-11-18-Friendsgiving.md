### Saturday, November 23rd, 2pm at 1203 High St, Boulder

Some of you may remember an event last year known as Friendsgiving. Our host last year was Prof. Brad Hayes, who has graciously agreed to open up his home for another Friendsgiving event. It promises to be a wonderful event full of food and merriment.

Part of participating in this event is bringing something to share with the group. This can take the form of food, cutlery, chairs, plates, or any other miscellaneous items that might be needed. The only way this event works is if we all work together to make a delicious meal. We would especially like to share this US holiday with our international colleagues, and welcome you to bring a traditional dish of your own to share with us!

If you are interested in participating in this event, [please RSVP](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18Z9PKlecN_xSRXbwnRHnrICf2kcSEpAlyiYwWcjfWl0/edit?usp=sharing)
