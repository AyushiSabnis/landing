# Town Hall Thursday!

Graduate Student Town Hall occurs once per semester. It is a venue for graduate students to share their concerns with the department, ask questions, and give suggestions directly to the department chair, graduate committee, and graduate advisor. Past town halls inspired the graduate student Slack, the CSGSA, and demand-based course scheduling.

### Submit Questions

This semester, in addition to asking questions live at the town hall, you can also submit questions online anonymously. We hope this option will encourage more students to raise their issues. Ask a question now and any time up-to and including during the town hall.
