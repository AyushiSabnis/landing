# Quality of Life Survey

In Spring 2018, before we'd even had our kickoff event, the Graduate Committee approached the CSGSA about hosting a “Climate Survey” to assess the social climate of the department. The last climate survey was done in 2014 and was for the whole graduate school. You can read about it [here](https://www.colorado.edu/oda/institutional-research/surveys/social-climate-surveys/graduate-student-social-climate-survey). 

The Graduate Committee was naturally interested in fresher results that would focus more on the strengths and weaknesses of this department.  We also thought it would be a great way identify focus areas for the CSGSA to work on.  We decided to call it a “Quality-of-Life” survey to avoid any confusion about weather.

69 students responded to the survey, 27 Masters students, and 42 PhD students. You can read the detailed survey summary

Or the departments response to the top 15 issues

The CSGSA is still working on how best to address the issues raised in the survey and support the departments efforts. Join the #qualityoflife [Slack](https://boulder-cs-grads.slack.com/) channel if you  want to share your ideas.
