title: Join us on Slack!

We also use Slack for collaboration, sharing joy and ideas, and to support each other as a community.
If you are a graduate student in the  Computer Science Department at University of Colorado Boulder, join us on slack.

**Already joined?**

</a>

**Haven't joined? Here's how to join:**

We try and add all the incoming students before the start of the semester through an onboarding, but if that hasn't happened with you, you can request to get added in two ways.

1. Send an email to [csgsa@colorado.edu](mailto:csgsa@colorado.edu) from your *@colorado.edu* email.
2. Request a friend in the department to request to add you to the Slack Workspace. They can refer to [this](https://slack.com/help/articles/201330256-Invite-new-members-to-your-workspace) article on how to do it.

We are very excited to have you, so we will make sure to respond to the  request in a timely manner.
