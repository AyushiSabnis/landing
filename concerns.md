title: Reporting and Support

This page gathers resource links and information for issues that may arise during your time at CU.

## [Campus-wide resources](https://www.colorado.edu/dontignoreit)

Check out the [Don't Ignore It](https://www.colorado.edu/dontignoreit) website for a comprehensive list of on-campus resources. Their own website description says it best:

> There are options for seeking confidential support, reporting concerns, and learning skills for helping others. Don't ignore mental health concerns, harassment, discriminatory actions, unwanted sexual behavior, abuse in a relationship, stalking, and other abusive behavior.

## Department resources

Based on your feedback, the Graduate Committee would like to provide a better way to disseminate information about campus resources that are available to help you deal with issues that arise during your time here at CU.  As as start, weâ€™ve created an information sheet that includes some of the situations that can arise and where to go for assistance in each case. 

For many of these issues, **the first point of contact is the Computer Science Graduate Advisor, Rajshree Shrestha**. She has office hours listed on the [calendar](http://calendar.bouldercsgrads.org) and is also reachable by email at Rajshree.Shrestha@colorado.edu

### Anonymous Issue Reporting
We also realize that there are situations that arise that may not fit into any of these categories. In that case, you can fill in the [following form](https://goo.gl/forms/gKzOG6FW5YjK5iPl2) anonymously describing the situation. The Graduate Committee will determine how best to respond to your concerns and update the form accordingly if appropriate.
