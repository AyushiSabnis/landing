<h2>Anonymous Bias and Microaggression Reporting</h2>
Please feel free to use <a href="https://forms.gle/ezhYMjs3Q2Y24XBe7" class="alert-link">this link</a> to report microaggresions and incidences of bias.  This page is monitored by current graduate students, who can take these concerns to the department anonymously if desired.

Please note these students are mandatory reporters, so while you can choose to stay anonymous, incidents reported on here may have to be reported to the University.

<p><b>What is a microaggresion?</b>
A microaggression is a term used for brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative prejudicial slights and insults toward any group, particularly culturally marginalized groups.</p>

## [Campus-wide resources](https://www.colorado.edu/dontignoreit)

Check out the [Don't Ignore It](https://www.colorado.edu/dontignoreit) website for a comprehensive list of on-campus resources. Their own website description says it best:

> There are options for seeking confidential support, reporting concerns, and learning skills for helping others. Don't ignore mental health concerns, harassment, discriminatory actions, unwanted sexual behavior, abuse in a relationship, stalking, and other abusive behavior.

## Graduate School Grievance Process and Procedure

If you are interested in details of the grievance policy, the Graduate School's full grievance procedure document is available [online](https://www.colorado.edu/graduateschool/sites/default/files/attached-files/grievance_process_and_procedures_2019_final.pdf). It is a bit long, so we've pulled out some highlights in sections below.

If you think you want to make a complaint, we recommend talking to Rajshree Shrestha, the Computer Science Graduate Advisor ([Rajshree.Shrestha@colorado.edu](mailto:Rajshree.Shrestha@colorado.edu)). She is fully familiar and trained in this grievance process and will help you navigate it.

### Jurisdiction Flowchart
1. Is this an academic issue?
    * Is the issue a grade appeal or other purely academic decision?
       - [College of Engineering Grade Appeal Policy](https://www.colorado.edu/engineering-facultystaff/college-rules-policies/grade-appeal-policy)
    * Is the issue related to arbitrary, inconsistent, or capricious actions taken against a grad student? Such as deviations from stated grading/exam policies; failure to provide reason for dismissal; unfairness in application or requirements; actions that hinder student's ability to make progress?
       - Ask Rajshree for assistance with filing grievances
       - File a Grievance [with the College of Engineering](https://www.colorado.edu/engineering-facultystaff/rules-policies/grievance)
       - File a Grievance [through the Graduate School](https://www.colorado.edu/graduateschool/sites/default/files/attached-files/grievance_process_and_procedures_2019_final.pdf)
2. Are there allegations of sexual misconduct, protected class discrimination, or harassment?
   - Report to [OIEC](https://www.colorado.edu/oiec/reporting-resolution-options)
3. Are there allegations of research misconduct?
   - Report to [standing committee on research misconduct](https://www.colorado.edu/researchinnovation/rcr/research-misconduct)
4. Is there potential unprofessional conduct of teaching or research faculty?
   - Address through supervising administrator, [Academic Affairs policy](https://www.colorado.edu/bfa/sites/default/files/attached-files/PRDJanuary16_2013.pdf)
5. Is there a student conduct issue?
   - Report to the [Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution](https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/)

## Department Resources

The Computer Science Graduate Committee also maintains an information sheet that includes some of the situations that can arise and where to go for assistance in each case.

We also realize that there are situations that arise that may not fit into any of these categories. In that case, you can fill in the [following form](https://goo.gl/forms/gKzOG6FW5YjK5iPl2) anonymously describing the situation. The Graduate Committee will determine how best to respond to your concerns and update the information sheet accordingly if appropriate.  

Again, for many of these issues, the first point of contact is the Computer Science Graduate Advisor, <a href="mailto:Rajshree.Shrestha@colorado.edu" class="alert-link">Rajshree.Shrestha</a>. She has office hours listed on the [calendar](http://calendar.bouldercsgrads.org).
