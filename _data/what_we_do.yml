description: "The Computer Science Graduate Students Association (CSGSA) is a student organization run by and for graduate students from the Computer Science Department at University of Colorado Boulder. Its main goal is to **foster community** amongst graduate students in the Department of Computer Science and other affiliated departments/institutes. 


The CSGSA arranges **social events, professional development events**, and serves as a **central forum of representation** for graduate students, representing graduate studentsâ€™ interests to the department and broader university administration. We aim to **support graduate students** holistically throughout their program of study.  We are also currently running a [pilot program](http://bouldercsgrads.org/2020/10/07/app-feedback.html) to provide prospective PhD students with an initial round of feedback on their applications."
