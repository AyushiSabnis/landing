  The Computer Science Graduate Students Association (CSGSA) and Graduate Professional Development Club (CSGPDC) are two student organizations run by and for graduate students from the Computer Science Department at the University of Colorado Boulder. Our main goal is to **foster a sense of community** amongst graduate students and help in their **Professional development**.




  The CSGSA arranges **social events**, and serves as a **central forum of representation** for graduate students, representing graduate studentsâ€™ interests to the department and broader university administration. We aim to **support graduate students** holistically throughout their program of study. We are also currently running a [pilot program](http://bouldercsgrads.org/2020/10/07/app-feedback.html) to provide prospective PhD students with an initial round of feedback on their applications.




  CSGPDC holds a lot of events related to professional development and brings in speakers and experts from the industry to talk about various things relating to professional develpoment and strategies related to seeking a job.
