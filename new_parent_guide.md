title: Navigating Parenthood as a Graduate Student at CU Boulder
---




Being a parent is a sweet experience, though challenging, especially as a graduate student balancing academics, finances, and healthcare. We, Mohsena and Jubair, became parents during our second year of PhD studies in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. Here's valuable information based on our experiences that might help new student parents at CU Boulder.


#### Early Pregnancy

- **Pregnancy Test:** Conduct your test at the Wardenburg Health Center, where the first ultrasound is also available. These should be covered by the Anthem Gold Student Health Insurance Plan, but please verify with [studentinsurance@colorado.edu](mailto:studentinsurance@colorado.edu){:target="_blank"}.
- If you don't have Anthem Gold insurance, the [Boulder Pregnancy Resource Center](https://boulderpregnancyresourcecenter.com/){:target="_blank"}. offers confidential appointments and ultrasounds.


#### OB-GYN Referral

- Upon a positive test and decision to continue the pregnancy, congratulations! While Wardenburg won't assist with OB-GYN specialists, they provide information on where to make appointments. We visited [Boulder Medical Center](https://www.bouldermedicalcenter.com/){:target="_blank"} at Foothills. Remember, appointments are outside Wardenburg, so prepare for co-pays.


#### Medicaid Application

- Due to substantial baby-related medical expenses, consider applying for government health insurance through the [PEAK](https://peak.my.site.com/peak/s/peak-landing-page?language=en_US.){:target="_blank"} website, covering:
  - Pregnancy-related costs for the mother
  - Three months postpartum medical costs for the mother
  - Free Medicaid transportation for medical appointments via [IntelliRide](https://gointelliride.com/colorado/){:target="_blank"}
  - One year of medical costs for the baby (with renewal options)


#### WIC and SNAP Programs

- Apply for WIC while applying for Medicaid to get financial assistance before and after the pregnancy. The Colorado WIC website and office can be reached at [303-413-7520](tel:303-413-7520) and [Colorado WIC](https://www.coloradowic.gov/){:target="_blank"}.
- Also consider applying for the SNAP program through the [PEAK](https://peak.my.site.com/peak/s/peak-landing-page?language=en_US.){:target="_blank"} website.


#### Doula Services via Medicaid

- Hire a doula 4-6 months before your due date. Doulas guide you through pregnancy, labor, and postpartum, helping create a birth plan and ensuring a safe and prepared birthing experience. [Mama Bird](https://mamabirdinc.com/wellness/){:target="_blank"} offers free doula services: [info@mamabirdinc.com](mailto:info@mamabirdinc.com){:target="_blank"}.


#### Postpartum Support

- The postpartum period can be overwhelming, especially with breastfeeding. Order breast pumps mid-pregnancy with a prescription uploaded to an ordering website like [Aeroflow](https://aeroflowbreastpumps.com/){:target="_blank"}. or [Babylist](https://www.babylist.com/health?g_acctid=878-527-6823&g_adgroupid=144105463913&g_adid=649736105248&g_adtype=search&g_campaign=Brand-Health-BP&g_campaignid=18667628795&g_keyword=babylist%20breast%20pump&g_keywordid=kwd-868129487733&g_network=g&utm_campaign=Brand-Health-BP&utm_content=649736105248&utm_medium=paid-search&utm_source=g&utm_term=144105463913&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw5ImwBhBtEiwAFHDZx8TfE9E6R3cUFj62sL8NqR339VpnVer30kmPJPZYrFabm5AwF6Sa-hoCvpIQAvD_BwE){:target="_blank"}.
