After writing the [Climate Survey Summary]({% post_url 2018-03-28-Quality-of-Life-Survey-Summary %}), the CSGSA identified 15 common or troubling issues that we wanted the department to directly respond to. 

We asked the Graduate Committee to provide a brief response in the form of a table before the Town Hall on April 19th, so the issues can be discussed there. The table appears below.
