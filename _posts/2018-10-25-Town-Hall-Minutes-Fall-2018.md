Minutes from the semi-annual Computer Science Graduate Student Town Hall on October 25, 2018.

Agenda
----

-   Degree Requirements
-   Course Issues
-   Space Needs
-   Open Discussion

Degree Requirements
---

-   (PhD) Clarify the degree requirements and post it in the website
-   Conversation on degree requirements is happening right now, sending out proposals for feedback soon
-   Overhauled the [Graduate Student Handbook](assets/pdf/graduate_student_handbook_fall_2018.pdf) over summer - if something still isn't clear, please let CSGSA know so we can clarify
-   (PhD) What do (other students) value in a breadth requirement?
    *   (PhD) Two perspectives: foundation everyone should have, or way to encourage everyone to explore new areas?
    *   (PhD) Different graduate students want different things out of breadth- Masters might be looking to prep for specific industry positions (i.e. applied), where PhD might want to be prepared to teach a variety of classes outside their research area
-   (Sriram) Goal: make requirements small and keep them minimal, possibly make the same across the board for all graduate students
    *   Things outside out control: how many distance classes, total class, within the department, etc.
-   (PhD) 4/5 breadth courses is a lot
-   (PhD) Will new requirements allow PhD to pick up Masters along the way? Yes

Course Issues
----

-   Course Availability
    *   How would minimal requirements affect course availability?
    *   What courses are offered in summer?
        +   Two this summer- multilingual NLP and graphics, both with distance sections
-   Course Issues
    *   (Masters) After drop date, the professors have just decided to completely abandon syllabus- is there some form of accountability? Â 
        +   FCQs, but be nice and constructive
        +   Please feel free to approach one of the Grad directors/Jim throughout the semester
    *   Are the expectations the same for graduate (6000/7000) courses?
        +   Some ambiguity between 7000 topics and the 7000 that's going to be turned into a 5/6000
        +   Suggestion: Renumber 7000 transitioning courses
    *   Methods of CogSci is 6000 means it can't count as breadth. Any class can be depth with advisor approval

Space Issues
-------

-   (Masters) Many TAs have to (interview) grade in public areas- violation of FERPA
    *   Want to give out grading space before office space
    *   How far in advance do we know when we'll need interview grading space?
        +   Depends on the course
        +   Classes with more interview grading, allocate larger chunks of space, but some classes only have interview grading as needed
        +   Card access for interview grading rooms after 5pm gets removed
-   (PhD) desire for kitchen where you can actually cook and hopefully
-   Other departments have grad lounges where community is built
-   ECES 112 reserved for graduate students Mondays 8am-1pm
    *   8:30-9:30 is used for TA training
    *   12-1pm is used for CSGSA
-   Do graduate student use CSEL? Yes, for group projects
-   Why aren't we getting a new building?
    *   We need the Dean to be a CS person
    *   Movement to promote Jim to Dean Martin
-   No interaction between students in different labs
-   Is there a way to partition CSEL with a part for Grad students
-   Is there a way to use hotelling offices for interview grading?
    *   Issue is key access, using conference rooms is alternative
    *   If it has key access, can request for card access with the new system used on east campus
    *   Could we use a combination lock containing key in the meantime?
    *   Study rooms cannot be used for interview grading, but has anyone tried using study rooms in libraries?
        +   Business, Norlin, math libraries
        +   If they notice you're turning it into an office, you might not be allowed to book it anymore
