There’s a new student organization in town; the CSGSA. Our main goal is to foster community amongst graduate students in the Department of Computer Science and other affiliated departments/institutes. We plan to host a broad range of social events, professional development events, and serve as a central forum of representation for graduate students, representing student interests to the department and the broader university administration.

We’ve hit the ground running with several events this semester and a survey about how we can help improve the graduate student experience. We’d love for you to get involved! Come to one of our weekly planning meetings, *Wednesdays at 10am in ECES 116*, or send an email to csgsa@colorado.edu. We’re also on the Boulder CS Grad Slack in the #gsa_planning channel.
