'*' GCA and Grader hours depend on course enrollment. 

## How to get one of these jobs

Rajshree sends out a survey about three months before each semester to look for TAs, GCAs, and graders for courses. She then works with the curriculum/TA sub-committee to try and match the respondents with available courses. You can also find out about courses that need TAs, GCAs and graders from Rajshree. For PhD students, your research advisor might occasionally ask you to TA their course.

For upper-level courses, you need to have taken the course before or have relevant experience in order to qualify to be a TA or GCA. Â 

Typically, TAs are assigned with the following priorities

1. PhD students with funding commitment 
2. PhD students without funding commitment and MS students who have previously held TAs 
3. Outstanding GCAs and graders are also at times considered for TA positions, if needed. 

At all priority levels, you must perform your TA duties well. Students who have previously held TA positions and underperformed do not get picked up again.  

GCAs and grader positions mostly go to Masters students.

If you want an RA, you need to speak to a professor with research funding and convince them to hire you. For PhD students, the professor who funds your RA is typically your research advisor.

## How many hours will I get?

Hours for GCAs and Graders vary based on the enrollment in the courses, and are usually determined just before the start of the semester. In general, more students mean more available hours. For GCA's, the course instructor receives 20 hrs of GCA help per 60 enrolled students.

I went through the historical FCQs of courses being offered Fall 2018 to get an idea of past enrollment. Larger course size means more hours will be available. The department has been growing steadily for the past few years and interest in topics can vary, but the historical numbers can give you a rough idea of how many hours you might get.

## Maximum Hours

The university limits how many hours you can work in university positions:

>The campus [policy](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-hourly-employee-work-hours) limits hourly student employees in all University of Colorado positions combined to a maximum of 25 hours per week or 50 hours per bi-weekly pay period during the academic year including exam weeks, spring break, and winter break; and to 40 hours per week or 80 hours per bi-weekly pay period in the summer.

In addition, if you are an international student, your visa may place limits on how much you can work:

>In general, F1 and J1 international students maintaining status at CU-Boulder can work on campus a maximum of 20 hours a week during school. Refer to [International Student and Scholar Services](http://www.colorado.edu/oie/international-student-and-scholar-services/cu-boulder-hiring-departments) for additional information.

From [Student Employment FAQs](https://www.colorado.edu/studentemployment/faqs)

## Other On-Campus Jobs

Other on-campus jobs are listed at the [Student Employment Office website](https://www.colorado.edu/studentemployment/find-job). These may be especially interesting to you if you are on a F1 or J1 visa, as you can only work on campus.
