## Overview

The Computer Science Graduate Students Association (CSGSA) is a student organization run by and for graduate students from the Computer Science Department at CU Boulder. Its main goal is to foster community amongst graduate students in the Department of Computer Science and other affiliated departments/institutes. To encourage such a community, the CSGSA will arrange social events, and serve as a central forum of representation for graduate students, representing graduate students’ interests to the department and broader university administration. In addition, the CSGSA will inform and support graduate students throughout their program of study.  

## Responsibilities

The CSGSA has the following main responsibilities.

### Social

- The CSGSA arranges and promote events each semester in coordination with the department leadership
- Events will be varied and appeal to a variety of audiences.
- Members will be notified of events with plenty of notice and guidance given as to expected atmosphere (e.g. family friendly)
- Promote awareness of CSGSA activities to current students
  
### Graduate Student Representation

- The CSGSA shall appoint representatives to GPSG, Computer Science Executive Committee, Computer Science Graduate Committee, and other organisations as appropriate.
- The CSGSA shall act as advocate for the views and opinions of its membership.

## Personnel

2. Vice-Chair 
    - Run CSGSA meetings in the chair’s absence
    - Manage and maintain organizational documents
    - Manage regular email communication with members and student body

- CS Department Graduate Committee representative(s)
 
  
### Ad Hoc Committees

At any time the formation of an ad-hoc committee may be appropriate (e.g. a certain event, or issue). These shall be formed at the discretion of the executive committee. 

## Operations

### Membership

The following will automatically be considered as members:

- A graduate student in the Department of Computer Science
- A graduate student in an affiliated Department/Institute
- A graduate student working in a Computer Science or affiliated Department/Institute lab

Those who don’t meet these criteria may become members by arrangement with the Vice Chair.
 

### Procedures

- Meeting Frequency: The CSGSA shall hold regular, biweekly meetings during fall and spring semesters. Meetings will be open to all members. 
- Meeting Details: The Chair shall distribute a meeting agenda to members at least 24 hours prior to the meeting. 
- Meeting attendance: Executive committee members and elected representatives are expected to attend all meetings. 
- Social Events: It is expected that at least two social events shall be held each semester and the events be diverse in nature. 
- Commonly Accepted Public Forum (CAPF):
  - currently Slack
  - This can change in future terms. This can be changed without bylaw amendment process given reasonable conditions.
- Bylaw Amendments:
  - Directly Responsible Individual (DRI): here shall be the proposing member(s) of the executive committee and any proxies designated by these proposing member(s) 
  - Proposals: Changes to the bylaws may be proposed by the CS-GSA executive committee at any time. The DRI(s) must be listed on the proposal. The proposal must be published  to the CAPF. 
  - Discussion period: The discussion period for any proposed change is two academic weeks during a fall or spring semester. During the discussion period, dissenting opinions by CSGSA members must be published to the CAPF, then the DRIs are encouraged to discuss the dissent and consider modifications to the proposal. A change to the proposal triggered by dissenting opinion does not require a new discussion period (however, it may be chosen by the DRI(s) at their discretion). 
  - Voting period: Once the discussion period has ended and proposal modifications are complete, then the online voting period may begin. This will take place over one academic week with a verified voting process using surveys or other acceptable online tools distributed to all CS-GSA members through the CAPF. 
  - Voting conditions: Quorum is not required, however a simple-majority of submitted votes must agree with the proposal. 
  - Background note: quorum is not required as we have never seen quorum met on any survey of our members 
  - Background note: hyper-majority is not required as a simple majority is believed to be sufficient in allowing the CS-GSA leadership to execute policies effectively while giving the members a voice 
  - Ratification: Once the voting period ends, the CS-GSA chair shall review the results of the vote. If voting conditions are met, then the CS-GSA chair shall ratify the change at the next open meeting. If the CS-GSA chair, the vice chair shall perform this duty. If voting conditions are not met, then the proposal is rejected and can be reconsidered at a later date.  

### Voting

All votes will be conducted online and published to the CAPF, and voting will be open for one week.

- General elections of the executive committee will be held annually, no later than the last day of classes in the fall semester. The elected term begins the first day of classes in the spring semester. 
- Elections for representatives to UGGS, the Graduate Committee, and the Department Executive Committee will be held annually, during the spring semester.  The elected term begins the first day of classes in the fall semester. 
- The date of the elections will be announced two weeks in advance, during which time members may nominate themselves. 
- Bylaw updates, as described above, will also be conducted online for one week. 
- A vote of no confidence can be initiated by a member at a CSGSA meeting.
