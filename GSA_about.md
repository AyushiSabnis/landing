Our main goal is to **foster community** amongst graduate students in the Department of Computer Science and other affiliated departments/institutes

The CSGSA arranges **social events, professional development events**, and serves as a **central forum of representation** for graduate students, representing graduate studentsâ€™ interests to the department and broader university administration. We aim to **support graduate students** holistically throughout their program of study.
